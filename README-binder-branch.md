## Binder branch 

This branch is intended to be a persistent collection of minor variations to the main branch 
that allow the code to build and launch correctly on binder. 

Changes include:

  - Binder docker file that is linked to the root directory
  - Deprecated version of lavavu and compatibility fixes in notebooks
  - That's it for now
