## Notes

General - an introduction to programming projects - formalising the approach to programming
tasks (spelling out requirements, designing an algorithm, debugging, testing and checking).




### Day 1

Overview of the course content - Hands on nature of the course

Opportunity to work on your own data later in the week

Why python ?
  - Very general language
  - powerful ability to merge in other languages under the hood ("glue")
  - extensible
  - very widely used

Why not python ?
  - slow / interpreted language
  - fussy about minor things, relaxed about important things (!)
    - e.g. whitespace
    - e.g. variable types

Introduction to docker, what / why and how to use it later

Introduction to jupyter notebooks. Why they are useful and the workflow. (OK)

Introduction to iPython (OK)

  - help
  - tab completion
  - function tooltips (etc)
  - shell commands and other "magic"

Modules - how to import and use them (recap !)  ()

  - Modules are available for everything
  - Too many to teach you about everything
  - I am more interested in showing you how to get used to the python style and not be afraid to keep looking stuff up.

Data structures in python ()
  - numbers
  - strings
  - tuples, lists
  - sets, dictionaries
  - ? general container types (ordered lists etc)
  - ? Arrays, matrices etc
  - ? classes

Numpy - what does numpy do and what is it for ?

  - Fast manipulation of arrays of data
  - shorthands for array index ranges
  - masked arrays


### Day 2

Matplotlib

Plotting data

Plotting image data

Game of life example - numpy version and image plotting.

Iteration / looping and storing data to plot later.

(e.g. plot radio active decay solution v. finite difference solution)

Fitting a curve to data using `scipy interpolate`

### Day 3

Maps !!

(That will take all day)

### Day 4

Grids, triangles on the surface of the Earth. Triangulations 

AND TBA based on student interest


### Day 5

TBA getting started on projects

OR Sympy ?
