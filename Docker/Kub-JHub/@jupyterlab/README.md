## @jupyterlab - settings files

This directory recreates the user settings that are needed for the kubernetes environment.
The whole directory needs to be installed
in /home/jovyan/.jupyter/lab/user-settings at run time (e.g. as a pre-start hook)

**NOTE: These files will knock out the default ones in the base image**
