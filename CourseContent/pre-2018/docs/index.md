# VIEPS introduction to python

This course provides an introduction to simple procedural programming in python with applications to Earth Sciences. We will teach you how to import data into python, manipulate and transform it in simple ways, plot your information (including maps) and export. We will learn how to use the many publicly available extensions and modules to python, and particularly those which allow efficient computation and scientific analysis. We will learn how to solve _very simple_ differential equations using python itself and discuss how to build real-world applications using freely available tools. NOTE: this course assumes python 2.7 rather than python 3. The differences are modest unless you are supporting a major package.


The python community is so large and varied that there is no point in trying to *learn python*. Modules and ability to wrap existing code libraries create such extensibility and generality that it can be easy to see what some piece of code does but not be immediately able to explain how it works.
It is more important to understand the patterns of programming in python and be able to appreciate how to go about assembling whatever tools you need for some particular problem you encounter later.

To make this happen, we work through lots and lots of examples until the patterns start to emerge.


## Course Content

The course is a series of modules that address the kinds of problems we typically need to solve in science and, particularly, in the Earth sciences
where we are often dealing with geographical data reduction. The first three modules need to be looked at first because the more advanced modules
rely on knowing how to use these tools. The rest can be approached in any order provided you are prepared to take a python view of things (i.e. being prepared to understand a module being used without necessarily knowing how to use it in detail)
