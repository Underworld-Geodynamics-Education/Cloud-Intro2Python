    "\n",
    "The one major class assessment task that you need to hand in is from the [Game of Life notebook](/notebooks/Notebooks/Numpy%2BScipy/3%20-%20Discussion%20-%20The%20Game%20of%20Life.ipynb).\n",

    "\n",
    "  - What resolution can we reach ? \n",
    "  - Can we work out ways to make this run faster ?\n",
    "  - What if there is more than one happy state where new cells grow ?\n",

    "I also asked you to write some simple tests based on the known states of the game of life\n",

    "  - stationary configurations\n",
    "  - oscillators\n",
    "  - translators\n",

    "Finally I also asked you to consider what is taking the time in the code. How well does it scale to bigger arrays ?  Can you see any obvious improvements to the logic that might give better speed ?"
