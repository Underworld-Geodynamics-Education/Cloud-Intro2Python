    "We need to download some data for the examples. Some files are bundled with the notebooks because I am not smart enough to understand how to download them through the various web / ftp interfaces directly or I needed to filter or compress the information for the purposes of the class. Please go to the original sites if you need to use these data for anything other than the demonstrations in these notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most datasets are too large for the repository (and generally, that's not a place to keep anything which is not the primary target of revision management. The bundled data are compressed and will be unpacked (copied) to the `Resources` directory by the \"download\" functions in this notebook. If you mess them up, just run the download again. Anything that is undamaged will just be be skipped anyway.\n",

    "Are grabbed from the [NEIC](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/) - they are in the geoJSON format since that is very simple to read with python. The downloads are limited at 20k events so the time and magnitude range is whatever it takes to get just under this limit. The filenames give clues about that, but, so does the catalogue itself once it is read in.\n",
