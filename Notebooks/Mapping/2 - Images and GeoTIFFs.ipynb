These are standard image files (i.e. they are ``.tif`` files) but they also contain information on the coordinates and the base projection of the image. There are various tools for making and converting these images but one important thing to know is that they are the becoming a standard that you are very likely to encounter as a way to store data and deliver it on the web. If you download tiles of data served up as google earth layers, you may well find that you have a geotiff. \n",
