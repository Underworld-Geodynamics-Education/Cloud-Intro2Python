# Exercises

The assessment of this course is in two parts:

  1. Attendance at each day of the course and completing all of the in-class _challenges_ which will not be individually marked but which everyone is expected to complete and understand.

  2. Completion of specific exercises which build upon the course examples and which will be marked. These exercises are due one week after the completion of the course (2 weeks with prior approval, for example if you have another course the next week)

The assessment exercises which we want you to complete for credit in the course are in the following Exercise notebooks:

In the first exercise I would like you to make a map of "recent" seismicity in which you can highlight the difference between subduction zones and mid ocean ridges. Think about how to make this clear and explain why you chose to do what you do. It may also help to plot plate motion arrows on the map to highlight divergent v. convergent zones.

In the second exercise, you need to plot ocean depth against ocean age. You have the topography / bathymetry data and the age data. You should do this for the "deep oceans" to avoid including the continental shelves and, for that matter, the continents.

<!-- NOT THIS ONE !! -->

Go back to the groundwater flow exercise. You probably noticed we chose a pretty poor method for updating the pressure each time (we showed in the radioactive decay example that the method is unstable and goes crazy when the timestep gets large. It does so unpredictably too, so you may never know if the answer is good or bad). In exercise 3, you can fix this by implementing a stable method and trying to break it !

   - <a href="/notebooks/Notebooks/Numpy/Seasonal_averages.ipynb" target="_blank"> <!--_ --> Notebook: Template for Exercise 5 </a>

These two exercises challenge you to use `numpy` to full effect.


## Quid Pro Quo

The idea of this course is to open up the possibilities of `python` for you to use on your own research problems. If you have a pertinent question from your own research that you can frame in a notebook then you can ask us for advice - but only if you send it in with your other assessments !
