# Exercises

The assessment of this course is in two parts:

  1. Attendance at each day of the course and completing all of the in-class _challenges_ which will not be individually marked but which everyone is expected to complete and understand.

  2. Completion of specific exercises which build upon the course examples and which will be marked. These exercises are due one week after the completion of the course.

The assessment exercises which we want you to complete for credit in the course are in the following Exercise notebooks:
