# VIEPS introduction to python

This course provides an introduction to simple procedural programming in python with applications to Earth Sciences. We will teach you how to import data into python, manipulate and transform it in simple ways, plot your information (including maps) and export. We will learn how to use the many publicly available extensions and modules to python, and particularly those which allow efficient computation and scientific analysis. We will learn how to solve _very simple_ differential equations using python itself and discuss how to build real-world applications using freely available tools.
