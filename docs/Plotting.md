# matplotlib

A general purpose graph / image / plotting library which is very widely used. The documentation for
matplotlib is not exactly aimed at the beginner but the most helpful resource is to look at their
image gallery and pull out the things you need.

## alternatives to matplotlib

If you don't like it, try something else !  Seriously, in the python community there is always an alternative

   - seaborn
   - bokeh
   - plotly

We do not touch on the `pandas` package which provides database functionality along with plotting and other data reduction / manipulation but this might be a useful direction to consider if you need something different from simple plots.

## 3D visualisation

One or two examples in the meshing toolbox use `lavavu` which is a 3D visualisation package (built by Monash University with some help from the
  University of Melbourne). This is included purely for show because it can be helpful for some specific problems. If you ever feel tempted to use the 3D plotting capabilities of `matplotlib`, you will quickly come to appreciate lavavu instead.
