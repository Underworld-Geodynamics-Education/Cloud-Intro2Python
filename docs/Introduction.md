# Introduction

Getting to grips with the system we are using and understanding how to save your work

## Docker

The environment we use is hosted in a `docker container`
(see [docker.com](http://www.docker.com) for more information) which
runs in the cloud during courses, but can easily be run on your laptop later
so that you have the identical tools at your disposal whenever you need to
revisit the training.
