The following are some helpful links to documentation

## markdown

There are different dialects of the markdown 'language' and notebooks use the github
version which is optimised / extended for programming.

  - <a href="/files/Documentation/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf"> PDF version </a>

## `python` language

Google is probably your best friend in this section and, when you do a google search, the
stack overflow pages are often the most helpful ones to home in on.

## numpy & scipy

The pdf version of the `numpy` manual is on this system (numpy doesn't change much from version to version
but you might see some small variations). Likewise the `scipy` manual but here you might find it helpful to access
the inbuilt help commands in a notebook to double check.

## matplotlib

The matplotlib documentation tends to be very technical and deals with the underlying implementation in detail. Most helpful is the thumbnails gallery

  - [matplotlib homepage](http://matplotlib.org)
  - [matplotlib gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)
  - [matplotlib examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html)

  - <a href="/files/Documentation/Matplotlib-user-2.0.0.pdf"> PDF user manual </a>

## cartopy

  - [`cartopy` home page](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/)
  - [`basemap` home page](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)
  - ['cartopy gallery'](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.15/gallery.html)

## stripy

There is no user manual other than the examples and that is because we wrote this package recently and have still to do a manual.
On the other hand, you can always ask. The underlying algorithms themselves are in ancient fortran code that we wrapped in python and
made friendly. The papers for this are listed in the examples.
